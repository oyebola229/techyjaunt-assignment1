  Hello! My name is Oyebola Oyeleye, and I'm thrilled to share a little about
  myself with you. I'm an aspiring software developer and currently a student at
  the University of Lagos, where I'm pursuing my passion for technology and
  innovation.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of interests. I have a
  deep love for cooking, experimenting with flavors and creating delicious meals
  that bring joy to others. Dancing is another passion of mine â€“ I find it to be
  a wonderful way to express myself and unwind after a long day of studying.
  Additionally, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of Korean series,
  exploring captivating storylines and discovering new cultural perspectives.

  Thanks to Techy jaunt for the opportunity to begin my learning path in tech!
